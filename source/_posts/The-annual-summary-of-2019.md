Time is flying, it arrives at the end of year again. This is my first year working in Pinduoduo inc. It's so busy and it seems I arrive in the company yesterday. It's a good chance to talk with(recognize) myself again. I try to conclude from `work`, `output`, `life` and `destinition`.

### Learn from work

The first course I learn from the team is `Start with the end`. It means everything we do today is prepared for the tomorrow. And we should also realize whitch period the thing we're doing is in.

The second course I learn from the work is to try to `use English more`. There are so much rich resource in Medium, MDN, [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/) and even in twitter. It's the first time I met with so many foreigners engineer in the JSConf but I can't talk with them bravely becalse my English is not fluent. And it improves efficiency when look for some information through English.

The last but most important is `how to communicate`. It's a art to describe something easily to make others understand. So is the code. The judge the code is good enough depending on others can understand it quickly or slowly.

### Life

I enjoy the quiet time sitting in the Cafe the whole day in Saturday and it's also nice to chat with friends or family there.

And in other some weekend days, I take part in some FE activities this year —— `FDConf`, `VUE CONF`, `D2` and so on. From these activities I learn some some new knowledge. For exmaple, the article [How to make page run smoothly](http://muyunyun.cn/posts/a1be1d41/) is writen after listening the sharing of Liu Bowen in FDConf. And luckily, I get the chance to take photo with [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi) and get the
signature from him.

At the same time, I met with old fridends and made with new friends in these activities. Here is a snapshot sitting besides RanMo in D2 luckily.
