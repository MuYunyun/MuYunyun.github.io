Time is flying, it arrives at the end of year again. This is my first year working in Pinduoduo inc. It's so busy and it seems I arrive in the company yesterday. It's a good chance to talk with(recognize) myself again. I try to conclude from `work`, `output`, `life` and `destinition`.

### Life

I enjoy the quiet time sitting in the Cafe one day in Saturday and it's also nice to chat with friends or family there.

At the same time, I also take part in some FE activities this year —— `FDConf`, `VUE CONF`, `D2` and so on. From these activities I learn some some new knowledge, for exmaple, the article [How to make page run smoothly](http://muyunyun.cn/posts/a1be1d41/) is writen after   meet with old fridends and make with some new friends.
